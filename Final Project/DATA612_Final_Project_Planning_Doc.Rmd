## Assignment
Find an interesting dataset and describe the system you plan to build out. If you would like to use one of the datasets you have already worked with, you should add a unique element or incorporate additional data. (i.e. explicit features you scrape from another source, like image analysis on movie posters). The overall goal, however, will be to produce quality recommendations by extracting insights from a large dataset. You may do so using Spark, or another distributed computing method, OR by effectively applying one of the more advanced mathematical techniques we have covered. There is no preference for one over the other, as long as your recommender works! 


## Dataset
We intend to use the Jester joke dataset for our final project. Jester is a joke recommender system developed by the University of California, Berkeley Laboratory of Automation Science and Engineering. The Jester dataset contains millions of joke ratings made by users of the recommender system, which learns from new users. Our chosen dataset--several Jester sets of different sizes are available--describes approximately 80,000 users making over 2.3 million ratings of 150 different jokes. The Jester team collected these ratings from April 1999 to May 2003 and November 2006 to March 2015. Each user and joke is represented by a unique integer identifier, and ratings range from -10 (worst) to +10 (best). Learn more about Jester [here](http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/about.html).


## Plans for Recommender System 
We intend to use Spark, via R and likely *sparklyr*, to build a recommender system that predicts Jester users' joke ratings. Spark offers the distributed platform necessary to work with the larger Jester dataset, which would otherwise prove too large for our group's local machines to handle. Our intended system will draw on our previous assignments and select from a comparison of recommenders of different types. We expect to use matrix factorization in pre-processing, and we will employ various evaluation methods to select our final model.
